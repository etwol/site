This site was taken from a template on StyleShout
I customized most of the text, but the vast majority of the css and js was not changed
I don't take credit for all of the code, not even 90% of it 
But I do take credit for setting it up on github, and changing the images.
By the time you are reading this, the code has most likely been changed far beyond the original site
But I still would like to give credit to who it is due.
